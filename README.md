# NodeClient
## What is NodeClient? ##
NodeClient is a Minecraft client (forked from the HyperiumClient GitHub, kudos to them!), currently in its development stage. It will combine many popular features, in addition to suggestions and ideas from the community, in order to provide a unique experience designed for SteelMC (The Official NodeNetworks Minecraft Server).

##Updates##
Currently, this project works for Hypixel only (As it is freshly forked from their Github), in the future we plan to update it to work with SteelMC, so it can provide the same sort of features and of course more, because here at NodeNetworks we pride on delivering more for less than other people!
